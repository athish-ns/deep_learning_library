# Deep Learning Project

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a deep learning framework from scratch in Python. It covers the fundamental components needed for building neural networks, training them, and applying them to solve simple tasks like the XOR problem and the FizzBuzz problem.

## Overview

The project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding the core concepts of deep learning by implementing them from scratch. It covers building tensors, defining loss functions, creating various types of layers, assembling neural networks, implementing optimizers for training, preparing data, and finally, training and evaluating models on simple examples.

## Loss Functions

Introduce various loss functions used in deep learning, such as mean squared error (MSE) and cross-entropy loss. Implementations and usage examples can be provided.

## Layers

Describe different types of layers used in neural networks, such as linear layers, activation layers (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid), and dropout layers. Show how to implement and use these layers in the project.

## Neural Nets

Explain the concept of neural networks and how they are constructed using layers. Provide examples of defining and assembling neural networks using the implemented layers.

## Optimizers

Discuss optimization algorithms used to train neural networks, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants (e.g., Adam). Implementations and usage examples can be included.

## Data

Cover the process of preparing and preprocessing data for training neural networks. Provide examples of loading, transforming, and splitting datasets.

## Training

Explain the training process, including forward and backward passes, parameter updates, and optimization. Provide a high-level overview of the training loop and how it's implemented in the project.

## XOR Example

Demonstrate how to train a neural network to solve the XOR problem using the implemented framework. Include code snippets and explanations of the implementation.

## FizzBuzz Example

Illustrate how to apply the trained neural network to solve the FizzBuzz problem. Explain the problem and how it's formulated as a classification task. Provide code snippets and results.

Your usage section is clear and provides helpful instructions for users to get started with the project. However, it seems like you've asked me to "fix" without specifying any issues. If you have specific concerns or areas you'd like me to address, please let me know. Otherwise, here's a revised version of your usage section with minor improvements:

## Usage

To begin, ensure you have NumPy installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Once NumPy is installed, you can test the project by running either `xor.py` or `fizzbuzz.py`:

```bash
python xor.py
```

```bash
python fizzbuzz.py
```

These commands will execute the respective scripts and demonstrate the functionality of the implemented neural network framework.
