# Deep Learning Project

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a deep learning framework from scratch in Python. It covers the fundamental components needed for building neural networks, training them, and applying them to solve simple tasks like the XOR problem and the FizzBuzz problem.

## Overview

The project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding the core concepts of deep learning by implementing them from scratch. It covers building tensors, defining loss functions, creating various types of layers, assembling neural networks, implementing optimizers for training, preparing data, and finally, training and evaluating models on simple examples.
